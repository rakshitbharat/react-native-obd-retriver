# ECU Connection Verification Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive checklist for verifying the Engine Control Unit (ECU) connection implementation. The verification process covers the entire communication flow from Bluetooth initialization to successful data exchange with the vehicle's ECU.

## 1. Bluetooth Connection Layer
- [ ] Verify Bluetooth device detection and connection handling
- [ ] Check permission handling for Bluetooth operations
- [ ] Confirm device connection state monitoring and management
- [ ] Verify command queue management and synchronization
- [ ] Test connection error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Confirm Bluetooth disconnection cleanup procedures

## 2. Protocol Detection & Initialization
- [ ] Verify adapter reset sequence (ATZ) implementation
- [ ] Check initialization commands (ATE0, ATL0, etc.) are sent in correct order
- [ ] Confirm auto protocol detection (ATSP0) works correctly  
- [ ] Verify manual protocol setting capabilities for each supported protocol
- [ ] Confirm protocol number reporting (ATDPN) parsing
- [ ] Test protocol timing configuration for different protocol types
- [ ] Verify protocol state transitions (INITIALIZING â†’ CONNECTED)
- [ ] Confirm header configuration based on protocol type

## 3. ECU Discovery & Communication
- [ ] Verify ECU address detection in responses
- [ ] Test handling of multi-ECU environments
- [ ] Check ECU selection and switching functionality
- [ ] Verify header formatting based on protocol and ECU address
- [ ] Test flow control configuration for CAN protocols
- [ ] Confirm ECU responsiveness testing with basic commands (0100)
- [ ] Verify ECU information retrieval (adapter voltage)

## 4. Command Execution Framework
- [ ] Check command formatting (carriage return appending)
- [ ] Verify command timeout handling
- [ ] Test retry mechanisms for failed commands
- [ ] Confirm response parsing and validation
- [ ] Check adaptive timing implementation for optimal communication
- [ ] Verify command queue processing
- [ ] Test special command processing (DTC retrieval, VIN, etc.)

## 5. Protocol-Specific Verification
### CAN Protocols (ISO 15765-4)
- [ ] Verify 11-bit vs 29-bit header format handling
- [ ] Check flow control configuration for multi-frame messages
- [ ] Test ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) message segmentation and reassembly
- [ ] Verify CAN filter settings

### KWP2000 (ISO 14230-4)
- [ ] Verify initialization sequence (fast init or 5-baud)
- [ ] Check timing parameters specific to KWP
- [ ] Test header formatting and recognition

### ISO 9141-2
- [ ] Verify 5-baud initialization sequence
- [ ] Check timing parameters specific to ISO 9141-2
- [ ] Test header formatting and recognition

### J1850 PWM/VPW
- [ ] Verify specific timing requirements
- [ ] Test header formatting and recognition

## 6. Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Check detection of common error responses (NO DATA, ERROR, etc.)
- [ ] Verify handling of BUS INIT errors
- [ ] Test recovery from BUFFER FULL conditions
- [ ] Confirm reconnection after protocol errors
- [ ] Verify timeout handling and recovery
- [ ] Test adapter reset procedures after critical errors

## 7. Multi-Frame Message Handling
- [ ] Verify CAN multi-frame message detection
- [ ] Check flow control handling for multi-frame messages
- [ ] Test message reassembly for large responses
- [ ] Verify frame number tracking and sequencing
- [ ] Confirm handling of incomplete multi-frame messages

## 8. Execution Flow
- [ ] Verify the entire connection sequence executes in the correct order
- [ ] Check state management during connection process
- [ ] Test error propagation through the connection stack
- [ ] Verify event emissions for connection status changes
- [ ] Confirm cleanup procedures execute correctly after disconnect

## 9. Interface Integration
- [ ] Verify the `useECU` hook provides the correct context
- [ ] Check all ECUContext methods are accessible through the hook
- [ ] Test context state updates after connection changes
- [ ] Verify component re-renders on connection state changes
- [ ] Confirm loading states are properly managed

## 10. Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] Test memory usage during long connection sessions
- [ ] Verify resource cleanup on disconnection
- [ ] Check for potential memory leaks in event listeners
- [ ] Test performance with rapid command sequences
- [ ] Verify Bluetooth connection management during app lifecycle events

## Verification Process
For each checklist item:
1. Create a test scenario that specifically targets the feature
2. Document expected behavior based on OBD-II specifications
3. Test both success and failure conditions
4. Verify proper error handling for edge cases
5. Document actual behavior and any discrepancies

## Critical Areas to Test
1. Protocol detection reliability across different vehicles
2. Multi-frame message handling for large responses (e.g., VIN)
3. Recovery from unexpected disconnections
4. ECU address detection accuracy
5. Command timing optimization for reliable communication
