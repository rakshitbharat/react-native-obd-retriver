# ECU Connection Logic Verification Checklist

## Key Areas to Review

### Protocol Management
- Verify implementation of auto protocol detection
- Check manual protocol setup fallback mechanisms
- Confirm proper protocol initialization sequences

### ECU Connection Flow
1. Initial Handshake
2. Protocol Setup
3. Flow Control Implementation
4. ECU Communication Establishment

### Code Audit Requirements
- Compare old JavaScript logic with new TypeScript implementation
- Identify any missing ECU connection functionalities
- Review flow control mechanisms
- Locate unused ECU-related methods
- Document commented-out functionalities

### Critical Components to Verify
- Protocol detection routines
- ECU handshake procedures
- Flow control implementation
- Speed control settings
- Communication initialization sequences

### Additional Checks
- Validate error handling
- Verify timeout implementations
- Confirm successful protocol negotiation
- Review communication recovery mechanisms

## Action Items
- [ ] Audit protocol detection logic
- [ ] Verify ECU handshake implementation
- [ ] Review flow control mechanisms
- [ ] Check for deprecated or unused methods
- [ ] Document all commented-out features


we have used all the old javascript logics to src typescript project what i want is you check all the ecu connection logics in new src and confirm that we are not missing anything from old javascript logic to take for ecu connection 
a real ecu functions means connection or setting up first handshak connection with ecu to set a correct protocol and getting ecu
setting slow control and so on

yes check all things like 
proper protocol detection we have or not and if auto protocol dont work are we using manual protocol set
also check we have a proper flow control implemented in ecu connection 

also check if we have any unused methods anywhere for ecu or not and so on

also check which functionality is commented out in the project and so on

#codebase 

please check do we have robust flow control logic in vin retriver or we are missing anything its fine we have duplicate code
