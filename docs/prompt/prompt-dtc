Please analyze the following DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) implementation and verify:

1. Protocol Handling & Detection:
- Verify the protocol detection flow from Base to specific DTC retrievers
- Confirm CAN vs non-CAN protocol handling accuracy
- Check protocol state management and transitions
- Validate protocol-specific optimizations

2. Flow Control & Response Processing:
- Review the flow control implementation for CAN protocols
- Verify handling of multi-frame messages
- Check response parsing and validation
- Confirm ECU address extraction logic
- Validate raw data processing for different protocols

3. DTC Service Modes:
- Mode 03 (Current DTCs) implementation
- Mode 07 (Pending DTCs) implementation
- Mode 0A (Permanent DTCs) implementation
- Verify service mode transitions and state management

4. Error Handling & Recovery:
- Review error detection mechanisms
- Validate retry logic
- Check error recovery procedures
- Verify timeout handling

5. ECU Communication:
- Verify command timing and delays
- Check header configuration
- Validate response format settings
- Review multi-ECU support

6. Data Flow:
- Trace the complete data path from command to parsed DTCs
- Verify data transformations at each step
- Check data validation points
- Confirm raw response handling

7. Compatibility:
- Verify support for all OBD-II protocols
- Check handling of manufacturer-specific protocols
- Validate protocol switching
- Review backward compatibility

8. State Management:
- Verify protocol state tracking
- Check configuration state management
- Review session state handling
- Validate cleanup procedures

Please provide specific code examples where issues are found and suggest improvements while maintaining the original logic.

Focus areas for specific protocols:
- CAN (11/500, 29/500): Flow control, multi-frame
- KWP2000: Timing, message format
- ISO9141-2: Initialize sequence
- J1850: Response handling

The implementation should match the standard SAE J1979 specifications for DTC retrieval.
