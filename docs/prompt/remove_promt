I think we should carefully remove everything for ECU connection for now
because we need to completely rewrite it.
Let's start by removing it entirely.

Note that we have Yarn, TypeScript, and lint properly implemented.
Be careful not to remove anything else because we are going to rewrite the ECU connection flow again.

We only need to focus on the src folder, so don't perform operations anywhere else.

Why are you touching Clear DTC, DTC, or VIN retriever or elsewhere?
They are fine as they are. We are a retriever class, not a real ECU or Bluetooth maintainer.
The ECU connection flow just connects with ECU and sets up the ECU connection with the Bluetooth app,
so just remove things about connecting with ECU. Don't touch anything else.

Don't leave any functions marked as "will be rewritten again in future".
We want to make this library ECU connection-less, and for now it will only have DTC, Clear DTC, VIN, and live data capabilities.

Only remove ECU-related things. Don't touch anything else and don't comment out the code - just remove it.

If something is used for DTC or anything else, don't change the types or constants.
Let them remain because we are going to recreate everything.
Understand that we are here to clean ECU connection to start over.

We should keep the placeholder hook functions which are used by other functions,
including their types and constants.

Why are you touching:
- src/ecu/hooks/useDTCRetriever.ts
- src/ecu/retrievers/BaseDTCRetriever.ts
- src/ecu/retrievers/CurrentDTCRetriever.ts
- src/ecu/retrievers/index.ts
- src/ecu/retrievers/PendingDTCRetriever.ts
- src/ecu/retrievers/PermanentDTCRetriever.ts
- src/ecu/retrievers/types.ts
- src/ecu/services/connectionService.ts
with functions for get VIN or DTC raw, etc.?

Don't comment out constants in:
src/ecu/utils/constants.ts
Leave them there because removing constants will create lint errors,
and we can review them later.

I also notice many types removed from:
src/ecu/utils/types.ts

Please understand that even though we can resolve things by creating mocks,
we won't be able to recreate all ECU functionality without these placeholder items.

Don't remove any placeholder functions from hooks, retrievers, services, or utils.
We can resolve functions like we do in mock tests by returning fake desired values.
Don't comment any constants or remove any types - I repeat this point.

Please note: If a function is used anywhere for ECU communication, do not remove it. Keep it as a placeholder and return mock responses similar to our test cases. This way, we will only need to add the actual logic later. This is our current requirement.

Start the changes from scratch.
Important: Do not modify anything that is not directly related to ECU communication. This is a strict requirement.
